    - Light Intensity Sensor

    -- objectives -- 
- 16 bit sfrs for: 
    - timer 2 reload (RCAP2H, RCAP2L) and timer 2 (T2H, T2L).
    - timer 3 reload (TMR3RLH, TMR3RLL) and timer 3 (TMR3H, TMR3L)
    - analog to digital converter (ADC) (ADC0H, ADC0L) for AIN0.
- sbit for 7-seg display (use BCD decoder with light test)
- timer 3 overflow as the conversion start to the ADC (timer3 initialization).
- sample rate of 50,000 Hz (50 ms (delay) x 1000 Hz (1 ms)).
- interrupt for ADC conversion and service it with a routine to get the 
  result. (ADC initialization)
- timer 2 overflow to create delay (50 ms).
- display number function for intensity of light in 7-seg display.
- oscillator initialization function (16.0 MHz). Turn external  oscillator off 
  and use internal oscillator.
- port initialization function (P1.0-P1.7 & P0.0-7). 
    - P1.0-3 as push-pull
    - P1.4-7 as open-drain (P1.7 for push-button (calibration))
    - P0.0-3 as push-pull output and P0.4-7 as open-drain.
        - P0.0 route /SYSCLK (experiment) (XBRn config)
        - P0.1 LED output for calibration indication.
- delay function 1 ms delay (Wait_ms).
- scale function to scale measurement value to between 0-9.
- calibrate function to calibrate min and max light intensities for a specific
  environment.

measurement_result ranges:
  min light intensity: 610
  max light intensity: 4095

*** Note ***:
When entering calibration or calibrating the min/max intensities, do not press 
the button (P1.7, S1) longer than half a second (0.5 second = 500 
milliseconds) or 3/4 of a second, as this could potentially introduce a bug.
if the bug is suspected, reset the chip with the reset button to start over.
